# Summary

A 3D-printable cover for a Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, that also holds a small LED ring for vision stuff (don't ask me how that works, I'm just a simple designer).  This webcam (available on Andymark.com) doesn't come with very convenient mounting hardware, but this cover keeps it securely in place while four mounting holes allow you to conveniently connect it to your team's robot.

## Before You Print!

To make this mounting system work, you need to (carefully) disassemble the camera to remove the flexible mount it comes with.  You might want to have a couple extra cameras around as backup!

Cut out a small piece of foam and insert it behind the camera to keep it firmly in place.

The LEDs fit into the front ring of the cover.

We attached our camera to a simple linkage to raise and lower it.
